## 📝 Description
This project will help to bridge the gap between doctors and patients. All this is done with the help of a user-friendly, easy and robust software system.
We have 3 logins- for Patient, RMPs and Doctors. We have implemented a dashboard where doctor can see the appointments scheduled for the day. Patient or Rural Medical Representatives (RMPs) can book appointments on behalf of patients by choosing amongst the different slots available. Also, we can see the patient vitals information.
